Hey everyone.

ZealousBot is a handy Discord bot that creates and resides in it's own channel [i](#zealousbot)[/i]. It has several cronjobs (chronological jobs) informing users about daily resets, news updates etc and also includes a list of commands to request specific MS2 details. See the list below for more information. Want to contribute / report bugs? Open up an issue or pull request on [url="https://github.com/roberrrt-s/ZealousBot"]the github page[/url]

I can be reached through Discord as Preversive (Robert)#6611.

[b]Installation (discord server owners)[/b]

 - [url="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=499249546585571357&scope=bot&permissions=8"]Invite the bot[/url] to your own discord server
 - Grant the bot admin rights (don't worry, it has been trained to ignore everything except the following channels:)

 	- #zealousbot
 	- #daily-guildquest
 	- #official-nexon-news

 That's it!

 I'm hosting the bot for you, and it serves all these servers at the same time.

[b]Commands[/b]

 - +help Returns an embed message with all commands and cronjobs
 - +servertime Returns the current server time in UTC
 - +setdaily <daily guildquest> Updates the daily guild quest channel
 - +serverstatus Immediately pings the MS2 login server to check it's status

[b]Cronjobs[/b] 

- dailyReset every day except Friday at 0:00 UTC
- weeklyReset every Friday night at 0:00 UTC
- guildQuestReset every day at 0:00 UTC
- checkNewsWebsite every 30 minutes
- checkLoginServer every 5 minutes when online, every minute when offline

[b]Personalization[/b]

ZealousBot creates his own channels, or will use your current channels with the names up top. To change those, you'll have to host your own version of ZealousBot (see Developers note). You can however, drag and drop the channels from the created category, and even delete the category entirely. You can remove the #daily-guildquest channel as well, but it will be recreated as soon as someone uses the +setdaily command. I'm working on a way to enable / disable certain features.

[b]TODO[/b]
- Stop automatically creating channels for features, but rather use +addchannel if you want to 'subscribe' to functionalites. to functionalites.
